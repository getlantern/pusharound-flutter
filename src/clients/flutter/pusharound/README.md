# Pusharound

A client-side package for the pusharound protocol. For use in Flutter applications, in conjunction with the [pusharound back-end library](https://github.com/getlantern/pusharound). Currently built around [pushy](pushy.me), though more providers may be added in the future.

Pusharound implements a transport using push notification systems, as described in [The Use of Push Notification in Censorship Circumvention](https://www.petsymposium.org/foci/2023/foci-2023-0009.pdf) by Diwen Xue and Roya Ensafi.

See the /example folder for a standalone example application.
