# pusharound

pusharound is used to send data to users via push notification systems. The intended use case is in censorship circumvention. This is a Flutter client for getlantern/pusharound.

Inspired by Diwen Xue and Roya Ensafi's brilliant paper, [The Use of Push Notification in Censorship Circumvention](https://www.petsymposium.org/foci/2023/foci-2023-0009.pdf).
