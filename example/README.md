# example

An example Flutter application utilizing the Pusharound system, backed by [Pushy](https://pushy.me). With a Pushy account, one can send notifications to the client - directly from Pushy, or via a Pusharound back-end. Streams can also be sent to the client, which will display an MD5 checksum of the stream.

Note that Pushy does not support native desktop clients and therefore neither does this example application. To test on desktop, build for Web (e.g. Chrome). Pushy will use WebPush to deliver notifications to the app.
