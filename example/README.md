# example

An example Flutter application utilizing the Pusharound system, backed by [Pushy](https://pushy.me). With a Pushy account, one can send notifications to the client - directly from Pushy, or via a Pusharound back-end. Streams can also be sent to the client, which will display an MD5 checksum of the stream.

This example only supports web apps. This is because Pushy does not support native desktop clients and delivering push notifications to simulated mobile devices is difficult. The pusharound library itself supports all platforms!
